# CarPool
<strong>Ridesharing web application using Python/Django</strong>

<a href="https://www.rohan-carpool.herokuapp.com/">Go to the app now!</a>

<p>CarPool is aimed at eliminating the fuss that usually goes like this:</p> 
<blockquote>"yeah I'll give you a ride, but you got that gas money tho?"<br>
"Sure, how much?"<br>
"Idk, maybe like 20 bucks"<br>
"WTF? 20 bucks for a 5 mile ride?!"<br>
</blockquote>
<p>CarPool solves this problem and makes ridesharing easier by presenting drivers and passengers information about their rides, 
and allowing them to pay or request money for the ride in an easy manner. <br><br>
Based on the distance and the car used for the ride, CarPool tells drivers how much gas they need to fill up on, and tells riders how much the trip will cost them. <br>
Users can even go straight to venmo and pay or request that exact amount instantly!
</p>

## Development
<p>The project was built using Python as well as the Django framework. <br><br>
Data scraping to obtain information about car fuel efficiencies, distances, gas prices, etc. was facilitated by
the use of several external tools such as the Google Maps API.
The app was deployed using Heroku, and can be accessed at the above webpage.<br><br>
